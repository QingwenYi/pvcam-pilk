Requirements

	Pvcam library - version 2.7.1.6 or later required
	Download from ftp site: ftp://ftp.piacton.com/Public/Software/Official/Linux/
	This driver has been tested to work on Linux kernel 3.2 and 3.5, on x86 32-bit.
	It is not supported on x86 64-bit.


Installation Instructions

	Build the rspiusb driver (make)
	Install the driver (make install)
	
	Whenever your kernel is updated, the driver must be recompiled and installed.
	
	By default the driver loads when a known PI USB device is powered on.
	The driver is only accessible to root users.  If a user other than root needs access
	to the driver, copy the file 10-pi.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/
	The default group name is 'video'.  Change 'video' to the appropriate group name, save the file,
	and either reboot or run "sudo udevadm control --reload-rules".

Debian package generation

	It requires to follow the typical dpkg workflow. In particular, you must ensure
	to have a GPG key and add an entry to the changelog on your name. The usb/
	directory should be renamed pvcam-pilk-usb-VERSION/. Then go to this directory
	and type: 
	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
	
	It will create a DKMS package, which ensures that the module is recompiled 
	everytime the kernel is updated.
